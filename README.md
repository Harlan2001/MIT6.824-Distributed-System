# MIT 6.824 Distributed System

This course, like MIT 6.S081, comes from MIT's famous PDOS Lab and is taught by Professor Robert Morris, a former top hacker who created the world's first worm, Morris virus.

In this course, a classic paper in the field of distributed system will be read closely in each class, and the important principles and key technologies of distributed system design and implementation will be taught accordingly.The course Project is also known for its difficulty. Four programming assignments take you step-by-step through a Raft consensus algorithm based KV-store framework, allowing you to experience the randomness and complexity of parallelism and distribution in painful debugging.
