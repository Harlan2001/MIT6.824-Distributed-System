# MIT6.824-Distributed-System

An operating system course for MIT undergraduates at MIT's prestigious PDOS Lab.One of the professors of this course, Professor Robert Morris, was a top hacker who created the world's first worm, Morris.

The predecessor of this course is MIT's famous course 6.828. Several MIT professors specially developed an x86-based teaching operating system JOS for this course, which was taken as their own operation course experiment by many famous universities.But with the emergence of RISC-V, these professors developed a new teaching operating system xv6 based on RISC-V, and opened the course MIT6.S081.Because RISC-V is light and easy to learn, students can focus on operating system level development instead of grappling with the many x86 "specific" compatibility complexities of the previous JOS.

The professors also wrote a tutorial detailing the design ideas and implementation details of xv6.

The course is also very interesting, as the instructor takes the students through the xv6 source code to understand the many mechanics and design details of the operating system, rather than staying in the theoretical knowledge.Each week there is a lab that allows you to add new mechanics and features to xv6, with a strong focus on hands-on development.There are a total of 11 LABS in the whole semester, allowing you to have a thorough understanding of every part of the operating system, which is very satisfying.In addition, all LABS have very perfect test framework, and some test codes even have thousands of lines, which makes people admire the efforts of several MIT professors to teach this course well.

The second half of the course will cover several classic papers in the field of operating systems, covering topics such as file systems, system security, networking, virtualization, and more, giving you access to cutting-edge research in the field.
